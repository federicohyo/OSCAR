# firmware/defs.h:40). The LiteX divisor is fixed at synthesis, so the baud rate
# is welded to the core clock: baud = 960 * f_MHz. Timer0 also runs at f_MHz.
#
# The DLL reaches only 100/N MHz for N=2..7. 50 MHz (N=2) is the ceiling.
# The DLL does NOT survive a power cycle (the chip always powers up on the 10 MHz
# crystal), so we engage it here on every start. Flash is non-volatile, so once the
# 50 MHz image is flashed it persists across power cycles; only the DLL-engage below
# has to run each power-up, and it runs automatically whenever CLK_MHZ != 10.
# The firmware must be built to match:  make F_CPU_MHZ=50 hex
# DEFAULT 50 MHz: this is the operating point for the reservoir / vowel work, and all
# 16 neurons are live here (at 10 MHz only ~6 are). NOTE: synaptic efficacy is
# clock-dependent -- a GAIN shift, not a kill (the old "50 MHz kills inhibition" note
# was wrong; it works once biases are retuned per clock, confirmed at bench 2026-07-10,
# see the synapse-efficacy memory). The fast-readout features (SRAM drain, 21-bit
# timestamps, mask, drop/stall flags, REC, on-chip pacing) are clock-independent.
